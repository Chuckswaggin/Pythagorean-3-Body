# Pythagorean-3-Body

This is the working file for a Pythagorean 3 Body problem written in Python using Maplotlib.

The Pythagorean 3 Body Problem is a gravitational simulation of 3 masses who have masses that form a Pythagorean triple (I will be using 3, 4, 5) and are placed at distances of the same values (again 3, 4, 5). Gravitational force is calculated for each mass and positions are updated.

I will try to create an animated graph of their movement. I think Matplotlib can do this, if not I will have to try something else. This is an early file at the moment as I am still learning Matplotlib.
